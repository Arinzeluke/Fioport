 [View Project](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/arinze.luke.ozioko/viz/PropertiesSoldAtTNState/Dashboard1) | [Download](https://github.com/Arinzeluke/SQL-FOR-DATA-CLEANING)
- Purpose: The purpose of analyzing this dataset is to gain insights into the real estate market, understand property characteristics, and identify patterns or trends that can inform decision-making. The dataset allows for exploration of property values, sales trends, and other relevant factors that may impact the real estate market.
- Skills Used in the Project:
 | Data cleaning skill with SQL
 | Data analysis skill with Tableau
 | Data visualization (dashboard) skill with Tableau
- Observation and Recommendations: Observations and Recommendations: I have observed that Nashville is a thriving city in the real estate market. Single-family houses are currently trending, followed by duplexes. This conclusion is drawn from the fact that the majority of acreage is utilized for single-family houses more than any other type. It is surprising that houses built in the year 1930 command higher sales prices. Additionally, I noticed that the peak sales month is June, closely followed by May. In terms of sales years, 2016 takes the lead, followed by 2015. Based on this analysis, I recommend that real estate investors, developers, or policymakers take a closer look at these observations for strategic insights and decision-making.
